## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a real-time, GStreamer-based video pipeline (Decode â†’ Detect â†’ Classify) using IntelÂ® DL Streamer on both CPU and GPU. It aims to evaluate how efficiently Intel hardware can support multiple video streams and AI models for edge inference. The goal: determine optimal FPS, stream support, and best model combinations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

> Create a pipeline (Decode â†’ Detect â†’ Classify) on Intel hardware (CPU and GPU),  
> run it across multiple streams, and evaluate FPS and performance for different model pairs.
